# Installation
Install cc65 by following these instructions: http://cc65.github.io/cc65/getting-started.html

# Building
Run compile.bat on your windows machine (or in wine..?). I'm not yet sure how to do this on Linux, but believe me I will find a way. I'm not yet sure if the makefile is supposed to work, but it does not for me.  

In case you did not already notice, at this early stage in development, this project is based on a pre-existing example.
